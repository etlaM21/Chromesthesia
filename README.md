**_Chromesthesia is a interactive audio visualizer. It's an audiovisual experience for VR meant to function both as new way to listen to songs as well as to learn about audio frequencies and audio manipulation. But most importantly, it's fun._**

You can **download the final release** here: https://github.com/etlaM21/Chromesthesia/releases/tag/v1.0 _(or just navigate to the "Releases" section of this repository)_

The Unity project is in the directory _Chromesthesia_ the If you'd like to **clone this repository and look at the full prject in Unity** you need to **download additional texture files** from [here](https://maltehillebrand.de/Chromesthesia/tex.zip) and extract them into _Assets/Ressources/models/introRoom/tex_. This is because some textures are too large for GitHub.
